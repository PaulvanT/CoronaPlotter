# StudyBuddy

This tool provides a simple way to start study sessions with a limited amount of time per page (set by the user). A bell sound will alert the user that the time for the current page is over. This way, the user is challenged, which leads to higher focus and efficiency. The process can be paused and resumed at any time. The inputs set by the user are: the start page number, the end page number and the amount of minutes per page.
